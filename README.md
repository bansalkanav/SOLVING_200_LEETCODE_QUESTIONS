**What is this channel about?**

This is a study group which will serve the purpose of building an open source community which codes and prepare for job interviews together. The aim is not to become a competitive programmer. Go ahead and add your friends or siblings.

**Which programming language to pick?**

Any programming language with OOPs is acceptable. But Java/Python3 is recommended. CPP is also a good choice because it is fast when compared to any other programming language.

**Why Java/Python3?**

Because later on we might build the projects. Java and Python3 have some of the best Frameworks that you can use to build any production level application. 

**What do you need to become a member of this group?**

You just have to be disciplined and punctual to become a member of this group. You will be removed from the group in case of any misconduct or indiscipline is observed.

**How much hours per day should you dedicate for this?**

Three Hours per day dedication. It all depends on your speed of learning.

**When are we starting?**

Starting 10th August, 2020 you will receive daily tasks. Till that time create a Leetcode account and start practicing the basics in your favourite programming language.

**What to learn before we receive the daily task?**

In any programming language of your choice, you should be comfortable with:
Variables, Data types(int, float, char, string, etc), Operators(arithmetic, comparison, bitwise, etc), Control Statements(if-else, for and while loop, break and continue)
Apart from this:
For Java -> Collections
For CPP -> STL

All the best!

:warning:  WARNINGS:

    1. The path ahead is going to be bumpy and difficult. Join at your own risk.
    2. Dedicate at-least 3 hours per day. Sundays will be off. Over doing something is also dangerous.
    3. We will be coding for at-least 2 months daily to see some improvements.
